THE VANS ARE COMING!! : A basic side-scroller game
**************************************************

You control the hero with the left and right arrow keys.

POWERUPS:

All powerup information (time left and type) is in the top right of the screen.
Colliding with a taxi will make you invincible for a short period of time.
Colliding with a police car will make you able to kill vans for a shorter period of time.

RULES:

You die if you touch a van and do NOT have a powerup.  Stay away from those vans!

If you die, the screen will go black, and your score will no longer increase.
Pretty standard for dying in games.


NOTES:

This game was created in two hours as part of a "2 hour hackathon".  The goal was
to write a working side-scroller with vans, police cars, and taxis, in the least number
of lines possible.
